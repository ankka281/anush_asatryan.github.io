        <h2>‚úâÔ∏è A Letter from the Future</h2>
        <div class="letter">
            <p><em>from Alisa, granddaughter of an oceanographer</em></p>
            
            <p><em>Dear Grandma,</em></p>
            
            <p>I found your box today. It smelled like salt, old ink, and memories pressed between photographs.</p>
            
            <p>Inside were your letters, your diary, faded pictures of coral reefs, whales, and underwater forests. I stared at them in disbelief. Was the Earth really once like this? So alive? So beautiful?</p>
            
            <p>We don't have any of that anymore.</p>
            
            <p>It's the year 2093. I've never seen the ocean as you knew it. The shade of blue you loved no longer exists. The water near the shore is heavy, dark, with a grayish sheen. Sometimes it feels like it breathes‚Äînot like a living thing, but like a wounded one.</p>
            
            <p>When I was a child, we were warned never to go near the coast without a mask. The wind carries toxic fumes. The sea throws up trash‚Äîplastic, barrels, debris. People stopped swimming long ago. Some beaches have turned into exclusion zones.</p>
            
            <p>Do you remember your favorite hammerhead shark? In your notes, you called it "the dancing shadow." I always dreamed of seeing one. But you passed away just a year before the last one disappeared. People wiped out sharks too quickly‚Äîfor soup, for handbags, for fear.</p>
            
            <p>After that, the ecosystem collapsed. With no predators left, small fish exploded in number, and the corals began to die. Without them, the reefs lost their color, their shape, their life. Now they're as empty as an old bone.</p>
            
            <p>You wrote about narwhals‚ÄîI used to think you made them up. Now they're called "Arctic myths." The last one was spotted in 2068, right after the Arctic Flame tanker accident. The oil spill swept across the northern arc. Scientists fought to contain it‚Äîbut it was too late.</p>
            
            <p>And do you remember the NGO Blue Lantern? That tiny organization you supported? I read in your letters how they went out every week to collect plastic fishing nets, how they gave talks at schools.</p>
            
            <p>Imagine this: once in 2075, they rescued an incredibly rare leatherback sea turtle‚Äîthe last in the region. It was trapped in a fishing net fragment. They saved it. For a week, the world held its breath: the news ran stories, social media lit up. People seemed to wake up.</p>
            
            <p>And then... the wars over resources began. Economies collapsed. Funding vanished. The turtle's hatchlings died‚Äîfrom microplastics in the food chain.</p>
            
            <p>I was just a child, but I remember. Everyone said, "It will get better."<br>
            It didn't.</p>
            
            <p>I live now on what used to be the coast of Vietnam. We evacuate often‚Äîflooding is normal now. The water level has risen nearly half a meter over the last few decades. The old lighthouse you loved to draw now stands alone in the sea, surrounded by silence.</p>
            
            <p>Do you hear that?</p>
            
            <p>Nothing.</p>
            
            <p>Because the whales are gone. Their songs‚Äîlost. Underwater noise from drilling, drones, and ships drowned them out. Even their strongest calls couldn't pierce those walls of sound.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes I open your photos and gently touch them. There's one where you're feeding seagulls. Birds no longer visit here‚Äîthey went extinct in our region from starvation and plastic-filled stomachs.</p>
            
            <p>I know you tried. You fought. You wrote articles, spoke at conferences, took pictures so the world would see. But the world chose convenience. And now children drink water filtered through sixteen stages. We don't eat fish anymore‚Äîit's too dangerous.</p>
            
            <p>I often wonder‚Äîwhat would you do if you saw all this? Scream? Cry? Or stand up again, like always, and start over?</p>
            
            <p>I'm sorry I couldn't save your ocean.</p>
            
            <p>But I can tell its story. I can remember. And maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI can inspire someone... to care, even just a drop more.</p>
            
            <p>I've printed this letter and placed it in a time capsule. Let it live until someone else is born.</p>
            
            <p>Let them know who you were.<br>
            And what your ocean used to be.</p>
            
            <p><em>With love and sorrow,<br>
            Alisa<br>
            your granddaughter,<br>
            born too late for your world<br>
            2093</em></p>
